# Fuzz Testing and Being a Dick #

I really couldn't help myself with this one.  Someone gave me the
privledge to play around with their pet project, and the first thing I
thought of was to read the HTML, and write a bash loop to spew all
over it.  We both got a kick out of it.

The end result is both hilarious, and kind of artsy too.  I think it
greatly encapsulates my *feelings* towards input validation.
