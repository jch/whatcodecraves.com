# Coding for Fun #

Working on Kwiqi's javascript stuff, my mood changed from desperate
frustration to enthusiatic happiness.  I shifted my focus from banging
out as many features as possible to trying to write the most beautiful
code.  I optimized for wording, clarity, and conciseness.  It was
great.

I left no room for duplication.  I didn't pollute my namespace even
though I could.  I refactored and refactored again.
