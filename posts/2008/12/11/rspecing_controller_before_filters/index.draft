# RSpecing Controller Filters #

* 'controller' references the current controller, so can do something
  like  'controller.should_receive(:foo)'

* test that the filter is run on the actions that should have the
  filter applied.

* avoid assigning instance variables in your filters because that
  causes a lot of coupling to the controller actions.  This leads to a
  ton of stubbing in the actions' specs.
