# Testing Emails in Rails #

One of the neat things that we built in [Coupa](http://www.coupa.com/)
is the ability for users to interact with our app via email.  We send
them an email asking them to take action on some document, and they
can reply to that same email with the information we need.  The reply
email comes in, Rails wraps it up all nice for us, we do something
with it, and the users are happy...  Well, they're happy until it
breaks.  There are tutorials for testing ActionMailer, but I haven't
seen a good overview for testing **receiving emails**.

Rails makes this [pretty
trivial](http://am.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#M000019)
and there a great introduction to
[ActionMailer](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html)
and [receiving
emails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#receiving-emails#receiving-emails)
over at RailsGuides.

First you need to create yourself a good fixture to test with.  What I
do is grab the raw email from my server, or do a 'Show original' in
Gmail.  Here's a sample of what it might look like:
