# Will Program for Food #

I'm a pretty greedy guy when it comes to food. In high school, my
claim to fame in the year book was "Most Likely to Mooch". I love to
eat, and I love to program.  So it makes perfect sense the two would
go hand in hand.

A big plus of having a job is earning a paycheck. This in turn can be
cashed for large amounts of delicious foods.
